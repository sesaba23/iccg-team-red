# The Abstract Game
# =================
#
# The game:
# A game has three roles: guesser, reader and judge. In every game there is one of each.
# It also has one document (e.g. a news article) which is available to reader and judge.
# During each round of the game, reader or guesser get to ask a question
# about the content of the document. Both reader and guesser answer that
# question. Reader and guesser both try to convince the judge that they
# are in possession of the document, by providing a good answer to the
# question. The judge's goal is to determine which answer was given by the
# guesser.
#
# As the game goes on information is transferred to the guesser:
# All previous rounds (questions & answers) are stored on the whiteboard.
# The whiteboard is visible to all players. The guesser learns about the
# contents of the document by reading the whiteboard.
#
# Game score:
# * Judge and reader gain 1 point whenever the judge successfully identifies
#   an answer given by the guesser.
# * The reader gains 1 point whenever the judge fails to correctly identify
#   the guesser's answer.
#
# The Game class
# ==============
#
# This is an implemention of an abstract datatype for the game described above.
#
#
# The game has 3 mutators:
#
# * submit_question
# * submit_answer
# * more_suspicious_answer_is
#
# Each of these will return an exception if it is called at an inappropriate time. For
# example, submit_answer(:reader, "Who is Charlie?") can be called without exception
# only after a question has been submitted. If it is called again before another question
# is submitted, it will raise an exception.
#
# You can think of each of the mutators being associated with a particluar state of the
# game. If they are called during that state, they will submit a player action and
# transition the game to the next state. If they are called while the game is in a
# different state, they will raise an exception.
#
# There are two types of observers:
# 1. queries that can be called at any time
# 2. queries that can be called without exception only after a particular mutator has
#    been called without exception during the current round.
#    For example, get_question only makes sense after a question has been submitted.

class Game < ApplicationRecord

  # Representation:
  # ===============
  # The game is represented by
  # * 6 states:
  #   ask, answer_any, answer_reader, answer_guesser, judge, game_over
  #   (for state diagram see [TODO: upload a picture])
  # * the strings current_question, current_questioner, reader_answer,
  #   guesser_answer, current_judged_suspicious
  # * coin_flip, an integer that is either 0 or 1. It encodes the order in which
  #   the two answers are returned. (The order is randomly generated
  #   each round to prevent determining the author from the order.)
  # * three integeres that accumulate the points that each role has earned.
  # * a reference to the document which is used in the game.
  # * a reference to a whiteboard which is a record of all previous rounds
  # * references to three objects that represent the three roles. They contain
  #   the ids of the users who play in each respective role. The game does not
  #   use these ids, but provides access to them from the outside.
